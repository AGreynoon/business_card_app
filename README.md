## Learnings
During this project, I focused on practicing the following Flutter concepts:
* **Widgets:** I implemented various widgets like `Column` , `CircleAvatar`, `Text`, `SizedBox`, `Divider`, and `Card`.
* **Assets:** How to add assets to `pubspec.yaml` file such as images and fonts, and how to use them.

## Installation:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have Flutter installed (https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).
3. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies.

## Assets:
This project includes the following asset:
* A simple business card image `(assets/images/DSC_7060 .jpg)` used to mark completed tasks.
* Fonts `(assets/fonts/)` to give the UI a better look.

## Usage:
* Run `flutter run` to launch the app on your device or simulator.
